# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is a discpline in computer science which involves the process of designing, implementing, intergrating, testing and maintaining software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the use and application of tools, process and process to design software programs.
Software differs from traditional programming in that: (i) it emphasizes on documentation while traditional programming little or no documentation.
(ii)Software engineering involves a team of developers and testers while traditional programming can be an individual task.

Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
(i) Planning- Identifying the project formulation and possibility for achievement. An evaluation of resources required and challlanges that may b faced is conduted.
(ii) Requirements analysis- This to study the interests and demand of the population of interest.Interviews and surveys are conducted to create detailed required specifications.
(iii) Design- This is where the overalll structure of the software is defined. The look and feel are designed 
(iv) Implementation- The actual code is written to build the softfware.
(v) Testing- This stage is for correcting any flaw that may have occured in the software. Test are conducted to ensure to ensure the program performs as expected.
(vi) Deployment - The program is delivered to the live environment setting. User training and support is offered at this level to ensure proper usage.
(vii) Mintainance- Usability and usefulness of a software is maintained by fixing bugs, delivering new features and making changes on demand


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile model is a repetetive process which unddergoes mconstant modification, while Waterfall model has detailed documentation and there is small scope for change.

The key differences; (i) Flexibility- Agile is  highly flexible and changes can be made even in the late stages, While Waterfall is rigid, with little room for changes when the project has started.
  (ii) Customer Engagement- Agile Model invlvolves customer continously through feedbcak and collaboration while in Waterdfall customer interaction is limited once the projcet is underway.

  Agile model maybe preffered in Evolving envionments due to its hiigh flexibility while Waterfall model is preffred in steady and well-defined projects.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
 Reuirements engineering is the documentation,analysis and handling of requirements linked with software sysems to be developed.
 The process of Requirements Engineering;
  (i) RequirementElicitation
 (ii) Requirement analysis
 (iii) Requirements Specification
  (iv) Requirements Validation
   (v) Requirements management
   Importance of Requirement Engineering in the software
   (I) Risk Reduction
   (ii) Quality Assuarance
   (iii) Cost and time Efficiency
   (iv) Clarity and understanding
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is breaking up a software system into smaller and more managablecomponents.
It improves maintainabilty by simple testing as it is easy to identify and resovle issues while viewing it in modules.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is perfomed by developers to verify that each unit is performed as expected. Tools used re JUnit,pytest
Intergration testing is perfomed by testers or developers to ensure that combined units work correctly. The tools used are JUnit,NUnit.
System testing is performed by QA team. Vlisate whether the sysytem meets funtional and nonfuntional requirement. Tools used Selenium,JMeter
Acceptance Testing is performed by end users. Ensures systems meets requrements and is accepted by users.
Testing is crucial because;
 (i) It ensures quality 
(ii) Helps in Bug detection
(iii)Ensures security
(iv) Ensures user satisfaction

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Tools that help help manage changes to source code overtime.
It is important as it ensure code review, Back up and recovery, history tracking and branching and merging.
Examples include; Git, Subversion and Perforce

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Their role is to plan, oversee and executing software development programmes.
Their responsibilities include project timing, Communication, risk management, budget and resource management and Reporting and documentation.
Challanges faced include; Technological challanges, Resource allocation and Communication breakdown.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintainace is the activities required to keep the software operational and improvepe performance.
Miantanance include
 (i) Adaptive maintainance- to ensure software changes to the operational context
 (ii) Perfective Maintenance-improves performance and maintanability
 (iii) Corrective maintanance- fixes problems that has occured after deployment of the software
 Maintanance is important  it ensures prolonged software life, enhances user satisfaction and ensures adapting in changing environment.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues faced;
(i) Privacy concerns, while hamdling user data
(ii) Security vulnerabilities, ensuring software is not accecsible to unauthorized user.
(iii) Biases and faireness,  ensuring software does not insuate biases.
Software engineeres ensure they adhere to ethical standard in work through;
(i) Removing biases in algorithm and data
(ii) Adopting ethical frameworks
(iii) Education and training

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
